TinyMCE is a well known online HTML editor produced by http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/. BlosHome embeds it in an offline way. This directory contains the successive TinyMCE release(s) which have been embedded in the different versions of BlosHome (since its release in a public repository ; so previous versions don't appear). 

Here is the detailled process to embed a new TinyMCE release
------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING : this process is given AS IS, so take care to double-check the steps by yourself !

0) Backup ! Or, if you work with a repository, remember to not commit in case something goes wrong.
1) Download TinyMCE at http://www.tinymce.com/ ; preferably a "production" edition (without "dev" in the name). 
2) Download the language packs you want to add to the default English one (you'll get a tinymce_language_pack.zip).
3) Rename "tinymce_language_pack.zip" as "tinymce_language_pack_<ver_number>.zip" (e.g. "3.5.5" for lang-pack about "tinymce_3.5.5.zip")
4) Run the first batch double-clicking on it (TinyMCE and its languages pack will be expanded under "tinymce_<ver_number>")
6) Double-check the point 4, then run the second batch which will irreversibly replace the TinyMCE in the BlosHome dev. tree !!!
7) Check in the BlosHome editor that all sounds right, creating a test article.
 
If EasyImage has been not preserved by the process above (it shouldn't, but we never know) or seems to be corrupted, you can download it at http://www.ffh-lab.com/ezimage.html, then re-install it by yourself or, if you're on a working copy, update its specific directory ("BlosHome/tiny_mce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/ezimage") from the repository.
